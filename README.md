Pac-Men Exercise README

Description:
This “Pac-Men Exercise” is a program where the user can declare a number of Pac-Men and then watch what happens when they’re allowed to move around the screen and interact with the window’s borders. This is a building block of code that can be used to run simulations of real creatures/objects or to make an interactive app or game. 

To use this:
   Copy the repository to your local machine, then open the .html file in a browser of your choice. An image of two buttons should appear. Clicking the “Start Game” button won’t do a thing until you’ve clicked “Add PacMan.” Feel free to add several. Once they’ve been added, clicking “Start Game” will make them move!  If this doesn’t work, please double check that Index.html is located in the same folder on your computer as the images and its .js file. This html file will not work unless its friends are in the same folder.

Improvements Roadmap:
     Pac-men are cute, but bunnies are better! I’d like to change the images to rabbits. Eventually I plan to make a game about rabbits using the basic principles taught in this exercise. It would also be fun to make the Pac-men change to a random color when they change direction.
